# Quasi-Adiabatic-Rydberg-Chain-2025

Codes for reproducing the data and figures of the article entitled "Adiabatically driven dissipative many-body quantum spin systems"

Authors: Paulo J. Paulino, Stefan Teufel, Federico Carollo, and Igor Lesanovsky


Basic Information about the Directories:

    - The codes are organized in Jupyter notebooks, written in Python.
    - The codes require NumPy, SciPy, QuTiP, and Matplotlib.


Folder Structure:
    - There are one main file that generater the elemets of the system, such as Hamiltonians and jump operators 
    - The file: OnePulse.py perferm the simulations for the dynamics of a single adiabatic pulse and saving the data
    - The file: ManyPulses.py perferm the simulations for the dynamics of many adiabatic pulses and saving the data
    - The other files are resposible for ploting the figures
